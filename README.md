Configuration profile for Handbrake
Profile for x265 and AV1, used for compressing video for the Plex server
Profiles "Oldies" are for TV Series or Movies from before 2000 as they usually are already more grainy and a lower quality compression is sufficient
## 720 - for TV series
- 720 x265
- 720 x265 Oldies
- 720 AV1
- 720 AV1 Oldies
## 1080 - for Movies, Concerts, Documentaries
- 1080 x265

Since 2023, I moved from compressing vdo in x265 to AV1
